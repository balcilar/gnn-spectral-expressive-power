# Analyzing the Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks in a Spectral Perspective

This repository consist of ICLR2021 paper on theoretical and empirical spectral analysis of GNNs

## Theoretical and Empirical Result of GNNs
Studied GNN's spectral analysis codes are in spectral_analysis_result folder. Those codes were written in Matlab.
You can briefly run each script for each method independently and see the empirical and theoretical frequency responses on Cora graph.
